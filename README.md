# My-Personal-Website
This website is coded so as to illustrate the modern best practices that I learned from my Udemy courses. For an illustration of the JavaScript framework mastery I gained from the Ultimate Angular and Ionic courses, see my app repositories "To-Do-List" and "Codeducation".

   My workflow for this website makes use of the following technologies: 
      • Task automation with Gulp, which allows for greater speed and ease of development and version control with Git, which allows for greater speed and ease of maintenance and improvement. 
      • Semantic and accurate HTML5, written with ERB - Embedded Ruby -, which allows for modular HTML file architecture, and making use of Emmet, which allows for greater speed of writing HTML code.
      • CSS3 including grid and flexbox, written with SCSS, which allows for modular CSS file architecture and greater speed and flexibility of writing CSS code.
      • JavaScript ES8, with modern tools such as Webpack 4, which allows for modular JS file architecture and Babel, which translates the ES8 into the more browser-compatible ES5.
